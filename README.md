# odin-landing-page
This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) (TOP) curriculum


I have to copy a landing page shown by an image, put in practice the flex layout wizardry I learned :)


## After Completion toughts
Things i could've done better

- Follow properly the task and do html then css from the start
- Not try to move things pixel by pixel for it to line up on my screen and only on my screen (looks 95% like the images on my screen, just minor font size and margin/padding differences)
- Maybe not use padding then later on margins to space sections around (i don't know if it's bad but it felt weird to swtich midway)

## My takeaways 

- The flexbox lesson realy stuck well in my mind (thx flexbox zombie & froggy)
- Continue doing what i'm doing, it seems to be working :)
